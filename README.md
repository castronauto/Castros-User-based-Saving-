# Castros-User-based-Saving-
This is a simple transcoding method that uses the username to convert a string into weird random letters, so that it can only be decrypted using the same username or key.

# How to use
1. Go into the [project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1172866731/) and remix it, or download the latest release and import it into scratch

  
2. Make sure that the "Make username "Numberized" block is used before any other blocks.
   - This doesnt need to be the username, it can be any string or code!


3. Now you can start using the Encrypt and Decrypt blocks, just make sure that the "Numberized-Username" operator is the same on both blocks, else it would come out as gibberish!
